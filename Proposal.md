# Project Desription
## About The Data
The data we have decided we wanted to work with is the Asteroids Neo Earth
Object Web Service API. It is a database focused catalouging asteroids, their
closest approach date and just overall data about them. The data set is comes
from the [NASA JPL Asteroid Team](https://cneos.jpl.nasa.gov/), NASA's center
for computing asteroid and comet orbits and their odds of Earth impact. It is
maintained by the [SpaceRocks Team](http://www.spacerocksapps.org/). They
are a "group of science enthusiasts dedicated to sharing space & science data
in a fun, interactive, meaningful ways". 
## Audience
Our target audience would be people who are interested in space. 
It'll provide a quick and easy way to get a comprehensive information about 
objects entering and exiting Earth's orbit. It will also be a place for casual
fans to get quick information about asteroids without having to do extensive
research about them.
## What To Learn About The Data
We are hoping to that our audience can learn background information about 
asateroids passing through Earth's orbits, even those that can be potentially
dangerous. A couple questions that can be answered about our data are:
1: What is the closest asteroid that will be passing Earth? It's dimensions,
danger? etc.
2: What asteroids will be closest to Earth at a given date?
3: How much will the asteroid miss Earth by?

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

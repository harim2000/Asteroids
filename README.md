# Info 201 Final Project - Asteroids

## Project Description
* What is the dataset you'll be working with?  Please include background on who collected the data, where you accessed it, and any additional information we should know about how this data came to be.

    The dataset we will be working with is a REST API that retrieves information about asteroids. The API was collected and is maintained by - SpaceRocks Team: David Greenfield, Arezu Sarvestani, Jason English and Peter Baunach. We found information about this data from a [programmableweb](https://www.programmableweb.com/api/nasa-asteroids-neo-feed), a website that has different kinds of APIS to explore

* Who is your target audience?  Depending on the domain of your data, there may be a variety of audiences interested in using the dataset.  You should hone in on one of these audiences.

    Our target audience can be anybody interested in relative asteroids in our solar system. Specifically, this API provides information on asteroids near Earth, so a group that would find this useful and interesting are people that have an interest in the movement and behavior of asteroids near Earth.

* What does your audience want to learn from your data?  Please list out at least 3 specific questions that your project will answer for your audience.

    * Which asteroid will be the next to approach Earth?
    * How many asteroids in the past 10 years have approached Earth?
    * How close, and what is the speed of the nearest asteroid to Earth right now?


## Technical Description


* How will you be reading in your data (i.e., are you using an API, or is it a static .csv/.json file)?
What types of data-wrangling (reshaping, reformatting, etc.) will you need to do to your data?

* What (major/new) libraries will be using in this project (no need to list common libraries that are used in many projects such as dplyr)

* What major challenges do you anticipate?
Not required, but optional: what questions, if any, will you be answering with statistical analysis/machine learning?Project Description
